    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding vs. Label Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Assigns numerical labels based on the order or ranking of categories. Suitable for ordinal categorical variables with a clear order.\n",
    "Example: Education levels (Low, Medium, High) might be encoded as (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "Label Encoding: Assigns unique numerical labels to each category without considering any order. Suitable for nominal categorical variables.\n",
    "Example: Colors (Red, Green, Blue) might be encoded as (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "Choice Example:\n",
    "If dealing with a variable like \"Education Level\" with a clear order (e.g., High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD), Ordinal Encoding would be appropriate. For a variable like \"Color\" where there is no inherent order, Label Encoding would be suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "In Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, the numerical labels are assigned based on the mean of the target variable within each category. It incorporates information about the target variable into the encoding process.\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "If you have a categorical variable like \"City\" in a customer churn prediction project, you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding. This allows the encoding to consider the impact of each city on the target variable (churn rate) and assigns labels accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "Covariance:\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase or decrease in another.\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "Direction of Relationship: Positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, while negative covariance indicates a negative relationship.\n",
    "Magnitude of Relationship: Magnitude helps understand the strength of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "Cov(x,y)= cov_{x,y}=\\frac{\\sum(x_{i}-\\bar{x})(y_{i}-\\bar{y})}{N-1}\n",

    "Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium, large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library. Show your code and explain the output.\n",

    "The covariance matrix provides information about the relationships between variables. Diagonal elements represent the variances of individual variables, while off-diagonal elements represent covariances between pairs of variables.\n",

    "Weather Condition vs. Wind Direction: The covariance between categorical variables may not have a meaningful interpretation as they are encoded numerically. Categorical variables may require other methods like chi-square tests for association."
